Assignment #5
-------------

### Required Tasks
- All [DONE]

### Note
Don't forget to set the `FlickrAPIKey` constant in `SPoT/FlickrFetcher/FlickrAPIKey.h` file to make the Assignment #5 working. To do that, you will need to get your own API key [here](http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html).

```objective-c
#define FlickrAPIKey @"<insert-your-flickr-api-key-here>"
```
